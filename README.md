# E4E-Onboarding-Project
In order to create a foreground mask of my street footage video, I used KNN/MOG2 to create background subtractors. In the video, we can see a side-by-side comparison
of KNN & MOG2. There was not a significant difference between the two methods-both were semi-effective. I definitely still need to figure out a way to fill in the shapes of people and reduce the noise in the image.
